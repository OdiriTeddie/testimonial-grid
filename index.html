                <p class="text--lg"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
                <p class="text--opacity-2">  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing  the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                <p class="text--opacity-2">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
